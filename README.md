The goal of this project was to rebuild a bash-like shell from scratch with the implementation of :
- processes
- signals
- redirections
- builtins
- environment variables
- pipes
- quotes
- working history
- exit codes
- Bonus : wildcards

In addition i decided to add a custom colored prompt for the look and the ability to execute commands within files :
- ./file
- /full/path/to/file
- upgrade
